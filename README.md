This is my old Tetris-like game I wrote some time ago in assembly for the classpad II, now ported to hollyhock. 
You need the hollyhock or hollyhock-2 launcher to run this program: https://www.github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/releases
The program was written in assembly, originally for an old loader I wrote to load the program. The program overrides some parts of itself because the memory map of my old loader was a litlle different. This does not affect the execution of the program, because these parts are not used...

Press Shift + Clear to quit.

This is based on the template https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/tree/master/app_template for the hollyhock-2 launcher by SnailMath forked from Stellaris-code forked from The6P4C: https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork

The hollyhock launcher is under the GNU license, so I think this should be te same license (because it is based on the template).
