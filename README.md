# CPoldTetris
_click on "CPoldTetris_V-1.0.0 Latest" on the right side of the screen to download the executable. -->_

This is my old Tetris-like game I wrote some time ago in assembly for the classpad II, now ported to hollyhock. 
You need the hollyhock or hollyhock-2 launcher to run this program: https://www.github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/releases
The program was written in assembly, originally for an old loader I wrote to load the program. This version is for the os version 2.1.2, the one which runs hollyhock-2, which is needed to run this.

Press Shift + Clear to quit.

Hollyhock-2 is available at https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/releases
